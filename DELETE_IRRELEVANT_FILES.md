# Files to be Deleted - Frontend Cleanup

This file lists empty and irrelevant files that have been identified for deletion in the frontend repository.

## Empty Files Removed:
- `DELETE_IRRELEVANT_FILES.md` (empty, no content)
- `README_UPDATED.md` (empty, no content)

## Rationale:
These files were created but never populated with content. They serve no purpose and should be removed to clean up the repository.

## Actions Taken:
1. ✅ Identified empty files
2. ✅ Documented removal reasons
3. ⏳ Files marked for deletion in next cleanup cycle

## Main README:
The main `README.md` file contains all necessary project information and documentation.

## Note:
This cleanup file will also be removed after the cleanup is complete.
